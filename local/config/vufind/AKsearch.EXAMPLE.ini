[Masking]
; Mask all call numbers (callno 1 and callno 2) and collections (including description) beginning with the  
; given prefixes by *. Use comma-separated list if more than one prefixe should be used. If one prefix includes
; another, the first one will be taken.
; Example:
;	beginswith = A, AA, LN
; ABT includes A. A comes first and will be used instead of ABT.
; Examples for result with "beginswith = A, AA, LN"
;	A34.B56 would become A******
;   AAA.546 would become A****** (if "A" would be after "AA" in the rule, it would become AA*****)
;	LN12345 would become LN*****
;beginswith = A, AA, LN
